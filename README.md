# Groupomania Front-end

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 11.0.7. (TYPESCRIPT);

You'll need the Back-end (and a MySQL DATABASE) for this app to work.

## Installation (nodeJs required)

Clone the repository.
In the created directory, run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Once built, move to the `dist/` directory (`cd dist`) and run `ng serve`. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## To Create An Admin (optionnal)

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
Click on the `Connection` button and select `Inscription` or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/signup`.
Fill in the field named `Pseudo :` with the value : `admin`.
Fill the other fields with chosen values and validate. 
(the first user named 'admin' gets the role, I choose that solution to avoid any conflict with the Database's models)
